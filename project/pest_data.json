For rice water weevil, non-rice years help break its cycle.\nField Sanitation: Remove plant residues, post-harvest debris, and weeds promptly. This eliminates habitats for overwintering adults and reduces food sources for larvae.\nHarvest Timing for Alfalfa: Harvesting alfalfa 7-10 days before normal bloom can decrease weevil larvae by ~95%. Early cuttings prevent larvae from reaching damaging populations.\nWater Management in Rice: Draining rice fields after flooding can expose larvae and eggs, reducing rice water weevil damage.\n"
